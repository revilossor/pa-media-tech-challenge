# PA Media Technical Test

An example api as per [the spec](https://gist.github.com/oliverdrew/93bc4ff677305bb5f15f1a0ec5d609f4)

### Running locally

You can start the application locally like this:

```bash
npm run docker
```

This will start a docker container containing the serverless-offline application with [src](./src) mounted in the correct location so recompilation still works.
